To create an Amazon clone with HTML and CSS, structure your page with a header (logo, search, links), product grid, and footer. Use Flexbox for the header layout and CSS Grid for the products. Apply simple fonts, Amazon-like colors, and spacing. Ensure responsiveness with media queries for mobile and desktop views.
